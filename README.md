# 🍪 DietetX 🔍

![Logo](/static/leaf_logo.png)

Currently down. [**DietetX**]() (wait 30 seconds for the website to load the first time) is an ingredient-to-nutrient converter for French recipes.

This is the first project I made, back in 2020-2021, when I was 14 years old and still in middle school. I'm proud of it, I was doing natural language processing before I even knew it was a thing.
It's also the first website I created. Anyway, in the future, I'll try to add a very simple authentification system, so that we can save the results of the conversion, etc.

## Usage

> Example : 1 poulet, 3 oignons, 4 gousses d'ail, 1 morceau de gingembre (ou 2 c. à c. de gingembre en poudre), 1 c. à c. de cannelle, 2 petits citrons confits, 150 g d'olives, 1 c. à c. d'huile d'olive, poivre, persil (facultatif).
